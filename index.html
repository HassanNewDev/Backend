            <h2>Past Of Backend</h2>
            <p>
              Backend development refers to the server-side of web development, which deals with the way a website or web application functions, including its performance 
              and operations. 
              It is responsible for managing the server, application, 
              and database that work together to form the backbone of a website or app ².

The past of backend development can be traced back to the early days of software engineering when the terms frontend and backend were used to refer to the separation
 of 
concerns 
between the presentation layer (frontend) and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software or hardware ¹.

            <h2>Present Of Backend</h2>
            <p>
              In the present, backend development continues to play a critical role in ensuring that websites and web applications run efficiently. Backend 
              developers are 
              responsible for controlling website performance and operations, 
              ensuring that visitors get what they came for and return in the future ².
